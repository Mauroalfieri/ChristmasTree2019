# ChristmasTree2019
The project contains the files HTML,Jss,Css and arduino sketch to create a web interface for ESP8266

The folder *htmlColorWheel* contains the web interface files before they are compressed to be included in the arduino sketch.

## htmlColorWheel
The files needed to create a simple web interface like the following:

![Christmas tree 2019 smartphone interface](https://github.com/Mauroalfieri/ChristmasTree2019/blob/master/images/Christmas%20tree%202019%20smartphone%20interface.jpg)

the original js file that allow me to create this inyterface was downloaded by this [project on gitHub](https://github.com/NC22/HTML5-Color-Picker) to which I added some js functions to send the color selected via Ajax to a new html page.

## Arduino sketch
In the folder esp8266 you are going to find the sketch for the ESP8266 WiFi micro controller and a subfolder **data** that contain the files css and js included by the main page html.

## case
The case is created by a openScad ( open source 3D software ):
![Christmas tree 2019 case openscad](https://github.com/Mauroalfieri/ChristmasTree2019/blob/master/images/Christmas%20tree%202019%20case%20openscad.jpg)

and printed with a self made prusa i3 3d printer:

You are going to find the openscad source and stl file of 3D case in the folder "3D case".
